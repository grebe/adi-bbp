current setup appears to work (using Vivado 2016.4)

after generating a bit file (using the fmcomms2_fir_filter branch of the ADI hdl repo),
run the build.sh to generate a new BOOT.BIN file (using the FSBL, U-BOOT and device tree files
that were present on the SD card image).

Copy (only?) the new BOOT.BIN to the SD card

haven't yet succeeded  in using a self-compiled kernel (uImage produced by ADI linux repo),
u-boot (from u-boot-xilinx repo) and vivado built FSBL.

To generate an FSBL, run "hsi" in the fmcomms2_fir_filter_zc706.sdk/ directory
and type the following commands:

set hwdsgn [open_hw_design system_top.hdf]
generate_app -hw $hwdsgn -os standalone -proc ps7_cortexa9_0 -app zynq_fsbl -compile -sw fsbl -dir .

this will produce an executable.elf file (FSBL)

to build the linux kernel, I did:

export ARCH=arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-
  OR
export CROSS_COMPILE=/scratch/rimas/xilinx/SDK/2016.4/gnu/arm/lin/bin/arm-xilinx-linux-gnueabi-

make zynq_xcomm_adv7511_defconfig
make -j uImage LOADADDR=0x00008000

kernel blob will be in:
arch/arm/boot/uImage

to generate device tree blob, type:

make zynq-zc706-adv7511-ad9361-fmcomms2-3.dtb

output will be in:

arch/arm/boot/dts

when I tried building u-boot, I set ARCH and CROSS_COMPILE as above and ran:

make zynq_zc706_config
make

it produced a u-boot.bin file (but no elf?)
not quite sure what's going on, don't care for now
also this machine was missing openssl related include files, so I edited .config to comment out

CONFIG_FIT_SIGNATURE

which disabled crypto stuff and allowed the build to finish
